# R3motion
R3motion is a thing i made in a day to fire BaseRemoteEvents And Change Values Of The ValueBase Instances

# R3motion 2.0

A Complete Remake of the whole thing but without the ValueBase Part, looks are inspired by Dex that is made by moon i think

Recomended Loadstring:

`loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DanMard/R3motion/refs/heads/main/LoadstringV2QueueTeleport"))()`
